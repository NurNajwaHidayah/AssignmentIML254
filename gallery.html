      This section features a gallery where I’ve collected some of the most meaningful memories shared with my friends during my time at university. These photos represent the laughter, support, and unforgettable moments we’ve experienced together. I’m truly grateful to have had such wonderful people by my side and always present through the highs and lows, bringing joy and comfort when I needed it most. Without their presence and encouragement, I’m not sure I could have made it through this journey. They played a big part in making my university life not only bearable, but truly memorable.
