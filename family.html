<h3 style="color:maroon;" style="font-family:verdana;"><i>When I think about the people who matter most in my life, my family and friends are right at the top of that list. My family has always been my anchor — the ones who remind me to keep going when things get tough, and who celebrate even the smallest achievements with me. They’ve shaped my values and always made sure I never felt alone, no matter what I was going through.
<p>
And then there are my friends — the people who keep me laughing, lift me up when I’m down, and make life feel a little brighter every day. Whether we’re studying together, sharing random stories, or just sitting in comfortable silence, their presence means a lot to me. I honestly don’t know where I’d be without them. Having a good support system makes all the difference, and I’m thankful every day for the people I get to call family and friends.</h3></p></i>
