<h3 style="color:maroon;" style="font-family:verdana;"><i>In their spare time, everyone has a hobby or pastime they love; it doesn't have to be something large, but it should be enough to inspire, calm, or simply make them happy.  Hobbies are a significant aspect of life, in my opinion.They not only help me better understand who I am, but they also provide a place where I can escape the stress of daily life, find inspiration, and occasionally pick up new skills.
<br>I think that my interests are a reflection of who I am as a person and how I view the world, not just a simple pastime.  There are days when I lose myself in a book, and other times when music is the best thing I can do to help me relax.  I also occasionally step outside of my comfort zone because of my hobbies, whether it's trying something new, going somewhere I've never been, or just taking little but meaningful pictures.</br></h3></i>
